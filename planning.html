    <h2>Inspiration</h2><br>

    <p>Most of the inspiration I get mainly from Instagram, following travel accounts or just typing in keywords I am interested in. For example:'mountains', 'volcanoes','long distance treks', etc<br>
    Other than that I watch lots of travel documentaries and browse websites like<br>
    </p>
        <div id="link-cont">
            <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com" target="_blank">Lonely Planet</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.roughguides.com" target="_blank">rough guides</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.loveexploring.com" target="_blank">loveEXPLORING</a>, etc<br><br>
        </div>
    <p>
    Lonely Planet website is my favorite source to find out more about any country's most interesting places. It is not overwhelming and nicely designed. There are many articles, including pictures and on top of that tips where to eat and where to stay, when is the best time any many more. <br>
    Once you decide where you would like to go, invest in one of their printed travel guides. They not only have guides for countries, but also for regions, cities and pocket versions. They are quite pricey but if you don't mind, you can buy used guides from <a href="https://www.wob.com/en-gb" target="_blank">World of books</a></p><br>

    <h2>Booking flights</h2>

        <p>Hunting for cheap flights is the beginning of your travel. So prepare yourself to spend a lot of time browsing websites and constantly checking prices.
        I use lots of websites like</p>
            <div id="link-cont">
                <a href="https://www.pelikan.cz" target="_blank">www.Pelikan.cz </a>,<a href="https://www.akcniletenky.com" target="_blank">www.akcniletenky.cz </a>,<a href="https://www.zaletsi.cz" target="_blank">www.zaletsi.cz </a>,  but mostly I use <a href="https://www.skyscanner.net" target="_blank">www.skyscanner.net</a>
            </div>
                <p>as it is really easy to use, finds you the best deals and it is very clear. Simply efficient.<br><br>
                You can find out more tips in section <a href="flights.html">Flights</a></p>

    <h2>Accommodation</h2>

        <p>Booking accommodation is not always easy. Sometimes there might an event going on in the destination you are planning to go to and the prices might be really high. That's why it's usually better to book accommodation quite a lot in advance. That is the rule for almost all Europe. If you are going to other continents, I would recommend to do research, pick a few options and save them. For example in Asia or South or Central America, you can just ask locals for advice and just walk into a hotel, hostel or any type of accommodation. In  most cases this will be cheaper. But it is obviously quite risky. You can end up not having any accommodation sorted for the night, but don't worry. In these cases you can always book last minute on <a href="https://www.booking.com" target="_blank">www.booking.com</a></p>
